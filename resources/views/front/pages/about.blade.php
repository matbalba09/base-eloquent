                    <p>
                        Our services include Online English Classes (ESL
                        Program), Home Tutorial, Center-Based Tutorial and many
                        more. We intend to deliver quality learning services to
                        students from different parts of the world.

                        Our ESL program aims to improve the students' level of
                        English. ESL classes cater to different language skills,
                        depending on students' English abilities, interests, and
                        needs. All programs teach the following: conversational
                        English, grammar, reading, listening comprehension,
                        writing, and vocabulary.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Our Home-Tutorial program is designed to help or assist
                        local students to cope up with their academic
                        requirements. We teach not only English but Mathematics,
                        Science, History, Filipino and other academic subjects.
                        The tutors facilitate learning by going to the home of
                        the learners and guide them by using our supplemental
                        materials in accordance with individual needs.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Our Center-Based program is done on-site. The tutees
                        come to the center after school and tutors assist them
                        as needed. Individual or group sessions can be done
                        according to the students' level. Apart from academic
                        lessons, we also emphasize on forming good study habits
                        and building good values among each learner.

                    <p>
                        We envision to facilitate learning with our unique
                        techniques and globally competitive approach but not
                        forgetting that the future of the learners is in our
                        hands as educators.
